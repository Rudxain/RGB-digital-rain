# ℹUsage
You can [go to the website](https://Rudxain.github.io/RGB-digital-rain) to see the animation on (almost) any device, or [⬇download](https://github.com/Rudxain/RGB-digital-rain/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) this repo as a .zip file. If you downloaded the zip, then extract it. Open `index.html` in your 🌐browser of choice (it also works on Chrome for Android!), and enjoy the real-time animation!

# Naming?
If you don't believe me, the "official" name is ["Digital Rain"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_digital_rain), even though the standard-de-facto is "falling code".

# Why I did this
Everything started when a family member (I haven't asked permission to reveal their identity, yet) sent me a link to [this article](https://dev.to/gnsp/making-the-matrix-effect-in-javascript-din), and I was interested in learning how it worked, because the code was so simple yet the result was so cool and complete! I also wanted to learn because I always wanted to make a canvas/image processing in some programming lang, specially if it involved animations.

I downloaded the source, started editing in [VS-Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code) to make some minor improvements, and realized I could update the font color for each individual char being displayed, so I decided to implement the feature using a color table sorted like a *🌈rainbow* (like those [RGB gaming PC setups](https://redtech.lk/file/2020/01/Omega_3.png), lol). I searched on the web to see if someone has done the exact same thing and only found [this video](https://youtu.be/CccQcYzsvI4), which is similar but not the *same* idea, because it has a limited color palette. So I decided to post my little project on GitHub for anyone to see and give me feedback.

Later I realized GitHub allowed anyone to create webpages and websites, so I started setting everything up, while also breaking my head trying to understand exactly what I had to do, lol. Some parts of the docs said I had to **install 3 different software packages** using NPM, other parts told me to do other things. But in the end I realized it was much simpler than I thought.
